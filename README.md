# MGPHot Enrichment (MusicBrainz â†’ Wikidata bridge)

This project is a first step toward enriching the MGPHot dataset presented by Sergio Oramas and colleagues at ISMIR 2025 with contextual metadata, using MusicBrainz as a bridge to Wikidata.

- MGPHot dataset: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15372063
- Goal: For each chart row (artist, title), align to a MusicBrainz Recording MBID, derive the Artist MBID and Work MBID (when available), and resolve corresponding Wikidata QIDs via exact property links (no name/title string search).

## What it does

- Searches MusicBrainz for recordings using artist + title, with normalization and fallbacks.
- Uses fuzzy title distance scoring to select the best candidate; if multiple plausible matches exist, it returns the most promising candidate and flags the row as "ambiguous".
- When a recording MBID is found, looks up:
  - Artist MBID(s) from the recording's artist-credit.
  - Work MBID(s) from work relationships (if present).
- Queries Wikidata strictly by MusicBrainz identifiers (no string lookups):
  - Artist QID via property P434 (MusicBrainz artist ID).
  - Work QID via property P435 (MusicBrainz work ID).

## Status and disclaimer

This is work in progress, vibecoded using Copilot / GPT-5. No claims are made for accuracy or correctness. Expect rough edges, incomplete coverage, and misalignments. Please validate and do not rely on results.

## Quick start

- Requirements: Python 3.9+ and internet access.
- Main script: `align_mgphot_to_mb.py`

Examples:

```bash
# Align the full input (tab-separated), write to stdout
python3 align_mgphot_to_mb.py --input hot100_charts.tsv --output -

# Sample N random rows with a fixed seed for reproducibility
python3 align_mgphot_to_mb.py --sample 20 --seed 1234 --input hot100_charts.tsv --output sample-20.1234.tsv

# Add candidates JSON column for ambiguous/not_found cases
python3 align_mgphot_to_mb.py --emit-candidates --input hot100_charts.tsv --output aligned.tsv
```

Output columns:

- chart_week
- artist
- title
- mgphot_track_id
- mb_recording_mbid
- mb_artist_mbid
- wd_artist_qid
- mb_work_mbid
- wd_work_qid
- status (matched | ambiguous | not_found | error)
- candidates_json (optional; only for ambiguous/not_found)

Notes:
- The script rate-limits requests to MusicBrainz and Wikidata and caches responses in a simple local JSON cache.
- Please respect MusicBrainz and Wikidata usage guidelines.
